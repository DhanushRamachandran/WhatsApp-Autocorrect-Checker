# WhatsApp-Autocorrect-Checker
Autocorrect checker for WhatsApp chats that detects and analyzes text corrections. Includes preprocessing, NLP-based error detection, and visualization of typing patterns to study autocorrect behavior in real-world conversations.

NOTE: This project is executed keeping SOLID principles in mind.

# Technical Overview
This project is aimed to rectify incorrect messages commonly caused by typos or lack of linguistic knowledge. 
It is implemented using a probabilistic model for a large pool of vocabulary initially calculated on a big dataset from kaggle.
TF-IDF technique is used to calculate the overall probability that represents the use of a word in a persons vocabulary.
This datatset increases/improves dynamically with more and more interactions with the user. Thereby enabling a customised recommendation engine.
The initial computed probabilistic dataset is stores as JSON file named "word_prob_json.json". As the name indicates it stores the probability of each and every word and gets updated/recalculated frequently.

exmaple piece from the JSON file:
"lodgings": 9.860297512067659e-06,
  "Intriguer": 8.963906829152417e-07,
  "ossify": 8.963906829152417e-07,
  "slough": 2.509893912162677e-05,

As you can clearly see, the values are in the range of 10^-7 indicating the diversity and quality of the dataset.

NOTE: misspelled words are also present indicating previous interaction with the user.

# How the Suggestion Algorithm Works?


The core principle behind the autocorrect system is that both misspelled words and semantically similar words should be considered as potential suggestions. To achieve this, the algorithm leverages NLP techniques to identify similar words and applies a set of robust string manipulation operations to handle spelling errors.
The algorithm incorporates multiple strategies for generating potential word corrections, based on permutations and combinations of the original input word:

Addition: Adding one or more characters at different positions in the word to form valid alternatives.

Deletion: Removing characters from the word to account for accidental extra keystrokes.

Replacement: Replacing individual characters to correct typos, often targeting common misspellings or keyboard adjacency errors.

Swapping: Swapping adjacent characters to handle cases where letters are accidentally reversed during typing.


# Class-wise Functional Breakdown

The project is organized into modular classes, each addressing a specific aspect of the problem:

WordOps: Handles all low-level string manipulations, including addition, deletion, replacement, and swapping operations. This class generates candidate words based purely on textual transformations.

SimilarityParser: Uses NLP-based semantic similarity to identify words that are related in meaning, even if the input is not a direct typo. This allows the system to suggest contextually relevant alternatives.

SpellSuggestion: Acts as a wrapper that orchestrates the process. It aggregates candidate words generated by both WordOps and SimilarityParser, preprocesses them, and computes their probabilities using the backend JSON model.

Suggestion Ranking

Once potential suggestions are generated:
Each candidate word is matched against the backend probabilistic dataset (word_prob_json.json), which stores the likelihood of each word based on previous interactions and a large vocabulary dataset.
Suggestions are sorted according to probability, ensuring that the most likely or most relevant words are prioritized.


By default, the top 3 suggestions per word are returned to the user, although this number can be configured manually.

This combination of string-level corrections and semantic similarity ensures that the system is both accurate and user-adaptive, providing suggestions that are contextually meaningful and reflective of the user’s own vocabulary.

The word recommended  as a suggestion is user-specific, meaning your words are updated in the backend probabilistic model that determines the preference of listing.


CONCLUSION

The WhatsApp Autocorrect Checker demonstrates a robust approach to detecting and correcting text errors in real-world conversations. By combining probabilistic modeling, semantic similarity, and string-level operations, the system is capable of providing personalized, context-aware suggestions. The dynamic nature of the backend dataset ensures that the model continuously adapts to the user’s vocabulary and typing patterns, resulting in increasingly accurate and user-specific recommendations over time. This project highlights the practical application of NLP techniques in enhancing communication efficiency and user experience while adhering to sound software design principles.
